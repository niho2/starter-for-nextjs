## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

### 1. Real-Time Friend System (NEW!)

#### Two-Browser Test

1. **Open two browsers** (or incognito + normal mode)
2. **Sign up** as different users in each browser
3. **Navigate** to `/account` in both browsers
4. **Check connection status** - You should see "Real-time connected" with a green indicator
5. **Send friend request** from Browser A to Browser B
6. **Watch Browser B** - The friend request should appear instantly without refresh!
7. **Accept the request** in Browser B
8. **Watch Browser A** - The friends list should update in real-time

#### Multi-Tab Test (Same User)

1. **Open same user** in two different tabs
2. **Change notification settings** in Tab 1
3. **Watch Tab 2** - Settings should update automatically
4. **Look for "Live" badges** next to section titles

#### Connection Monitoring

1. **Disconnect internet** temporarily
2. **Check status** - Should show "Real-time disconnected" with red indicator
3. **Reconnect internet**
4. **Click "Reconnect" button** to restore real-time functionality

### 2. User Profile Creation

- When you first visit `/account`, your user profile will be automatically created
- This links your Appwrite auth account to the friend system

### 3. Test Push Notifications

- Visit `/test-notifications`
- Click "Send Test Notification" to see browser and in-app notifications
- This tests the notification system without needing friends

### 4. Friend System Testing

- Search for users by username in the "Find Friends" section
- Add friends and manage requests
- Test sending notifications to friends

### 5. Push Notification Features

- Click "Send Notification to Friends" in the account page
- Friends will receive notifications through Appwrite's messaging service
- Toggle notification settings to control preferences

## ðŸ”§ Appwrite Database Status

- âœ… Database: `main-database` created
- âœ… Collections: `users` and `friendships` with proper attributes
- âœ… Indexes: Optimized for user search and friendship queries

## ðŸ“± Service Worker

- Located at `/public/sw.js`
- Handles push notifications with action buttons
- Automatically registered when app loads

## ðŸŽ¯ Key URLs

- `/account` - Main friend system interface
- `/messaging` - Feature overview and documentation
- `/test-notifications` - Test notification functionality

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Real-Time Features

### Real-Time Not Working?

**Check Connection Status:**

- Look for connection indicator at top of friend system
- Green = connected, Red = disconnected
- Click "Reconnect" if needed

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Look for real-time logs** - Should see "Subscribed to collection changes"
3. **Check for errors** - Look for Appwrite or WebSocket errors
4. **Verify authentication** - Ensure user is logged in

**Common Issues:**

- **"Real-time disconnected"** - Check internet connection, try "Reconnect" button
- **No live updates** - Verify both users are in same database, check browser console
- **Slow updates** - Normal for free Appwrite plans, should be under 1-2 seconds

### Performance Monitoring

**Enable Debug Mode:**

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.setItem("debug", "friend-realtime");
// Refresh page to see detailed logs
```

**Check Subscription Count:**

- Should see "Live" badges on active sections
- Connection indicator shows last update time
- Max 2-3 active subscriptions per user

The implementation is now ready for testing! All server-side errors should be resolved.
